# ParkerBot

## About
ParkerBot is my personal discord application. It's been a passion project that has helped me learn proper syntax and different ways to implement APIs from around the web.

This discord app comes with many features, including:
- Initializing catagories, channels, roles, and permissions.
- Adding and removing roles dynamically through reactions
- Displaying **public** user info
- Text-to-speech inside voice channels
- \+ More to come!
