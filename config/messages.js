/**
 * Messages configuration
 *
 * Defines the content for automated messages that the bot posts during setup.
 * This includes verification messages, role selection messages, server rules, and their formatting.
 *
 * CUSTOMIZATION:
 * - Edit verification.title/content to change the welcome message
 * - Modify roleSelection templates to change default formatting
 * - Add entries to customCategories to override specific role categories
 * - Edit rules.rulesList array to add/remove/modify individual server rules
 * - Use {placeholders} which get replaced: {categoryName}, {emoji}, {roleName}
 *
 * EXAMPLES:
 * - Make verification more friendly: "Hey there! Welcome to our awesome community!"
 * - Add fun formatting: "üéâ **Welcome!** üéâ" 
 * - Custom role messages: "Pick your gaming platform!" for a gaming category
 * - Add new rule: "**9. Have fun** - This is a community for enjoyment and connection!"
